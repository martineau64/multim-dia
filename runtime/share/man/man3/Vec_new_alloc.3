.SH NAME
Vec_new_alloc \- create a new generic vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <it/vec.h>
.sp
Vec Vec_new_alloc ( size_t elem_size, size_t length, size_t length_max
);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The  macro \fBVec_new_alloc\fR creates a new vector of \fIlength\fR entities. Unlike the macro \fBVec_new\fR, the macro \fBVec_new_alloc\fR allocates the memory for a greater number of elements than the vector length. Hence, the number \fIlength_max\fR gives the size up to which the vector can grow without any memory reallocation. This function allows to avoid to reallocate memory if the vector comes to grow up to the value \fIlength_max\fR\&. This may be useful if the vector is used as a stack. Note however that in most cases the user does not have to care about the real amount of memory allocated for the vector, since the geometric reallocation strategy allows to avoid to introduce additional complexity while modifying the size of a vector.
